      <title>From Meta-Analysis to Meta-Analytic Research Domains</title>
      <link>/en/post/metapsy/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 07 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/en/post/metapsy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent decades have seen an &lt;strong&gt;unprecedented increase in the amount of research articles&lt;/strong&gt; published each year. Evidence in the form of scientific publications has been increasing almost exponentially, with petabytes of research findings produced on a daily basis. In biomedicine alone, more than one million peer-reviewed articles are published each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;strong&gt;viewpoint&lt;/strong&gt; published in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ebmh.bmj.com/content/early/2022/07/19/ebmental-2022-300509&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BMJ Evidence-based Mental Health↗&lt;/a&gt;, Cuijpers and colleagues argue that meta-analysis, a common statistical method to synthesize the results of multiple studies, requires an upgrade to keep pace with the breakneck speed of scientific production in the 21st century. They propose the concept of a meta-analytic research domain (MARDs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARDs are living databases of an entire research domain, which are curated in a way that allows for fast, comprehensive and high-quality evidence synthesis. In contrast to conventional systematic reviews and meta-analyses, MARDs do not focus on one specific population, intervention, comparison, or outcome (PICO), but on an entire research field that is too broad to be covered by one meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While MARDs are resource-intensive and take time to implement, they come with &lt;strong&gt;considerable advantages&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduction of research waste&lt;/strong&gt;. In the biomedical field, a great amount of redundant, misleading, and biased research is produced on a regular basis (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962329-6.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MacLeod et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;). This is also the case in psychotherapy research (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796719301652&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cristea &amp;amp; Naudet, 2019&lt;/a&gt;). By centralizing all available evidence, unnecessary work can be avoided. Transparent and consistent standards can lead to more trustworthy findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence Mapping&lt;/strong&gt;. MARDs provide an overview of limitations and gaps in knowledge and make it possible to see emerging trends in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-Research (“Research on Research”)&lt;/strong&gt;. MARDs allow examining the methods and research practices of an entire field, and how they changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stakeholders outside the scientific community&lt;/strong&gt;. MARDs can enable just-in-time evidence generation for specific research questions. This can be used by e.g. treatment guideline developers or clinicians, to get an overview of the current evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Science&lt;/strong&gt;. MARDs provide data in a transparent, accessible, and interoperable way. This allows other members of the scientific community to re-use or repurpose the provided information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core features of a meta-analytic research domain (MARD).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;metapsy-a-centralized-hub-of-mards-on-psychological-interventions-for-mental-disorders&#34;&gt;Metapsy: A Centralized Hub of MARDs on Psychological Interventions for Mental Disorders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of a research project developing MARDs is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metapsy.org&#34;&gt;Metapsy↗&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of this project is to provide access to meta-analytic databases of clinical trials investigating the effect of psychological interventions (e.g. psychotherapy, preventive interventions, psychoeducation) on various mental disorders or mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metapsy creates a &lt;strong&gt;unified framework&lt;/strong&gt; for all available meta-analytic data across different indications and settings. All databases are (1) created by university-based research teams using state-of-the-art methodology; (2) updated regularly, at least once each year; (3) formatted using an identical and transparent coding scheme; (4) receive extensive documentation and metadata, including versioning and persistent data identifiers (DOIs), following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FAIR principles&lt;/a&gt;; and (5) are made publicly available via data repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers can also easily access the databases using the designated R package &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.metapsy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;metapsyData&lt;/a&gt;, and data can be analyzed using state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods; either using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.metapsy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;metapsyTools&lt;/a&gt; R package or using an Online Meta-Analysis Tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More information can be found on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metapsy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Metapsy website↗&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;project-description&#34;&gt;Project Description&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;mental-health-promotion-in-college-students&#34;&gt;Mental Health Promotion in College Students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StudiCare includes various online training courses for the prevention and treatment of mental illness, tailored to the needs of college students. In order to improve existing offers, the StudiCare panel regularly surveys undergraduate students at the Friedrich-Alexander-University and the University of Ulm about their mental well-being from the first semester onwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;College is a new stage of life in which students make the transition from adolescence to adulthood. This transition period is characterized by joyful experiences as well as new, stressful situations. These include, for example, looking for one&amp;rsquo;s own apartment, organizing finances and studies, finding new friends, getting used to a new environment, exam stress, etc. In the course of their studies, students are not only confronted with this new situation, but may also experience crises. In combination with possible risk behaviors, such as excessive consumption of alcohol or cannabis, this can lead to exhaustion, psychosomatic complaints, anxiety and depressive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;studicare-panel&#34;&gt;StudiCare Panel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The web-based panel survey is conducted in numerous countries worldwide as part of the WHO The World Mental Health Survey Initiative under the coordination of Harvard University among students from the first semester onwards. The aim of the survey is to obtain information on the mental health of students as well as on risk and protective factors for emotional stress during their undergraduate studies. In addition, more information on the willingness and barriers to using psychosocial interventions and counseling services will be collected. With information from the surveys, the need for help and support services will be assessed, existing counseling services will be improved and new online-based interventions tailored to the individual needs of students will be developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;studicare-online-health-trainings&#34;&gt;StudiCare Online Health Trainings&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The online health training courses from StudiCare are low-threshold structured self-help training courses. These trainings can improve the well-being of students and alleviate complaints in a wide variety of areas. They can be used independently of time and place, can be optimally integrated into the individual daily routine and can be conducted anonymously. In the training courses, students manage their complaints independently by working through numerous modules. Modules are based on cognitive-behavioral techniques that are also used in conventional psychotherapy. Essential here are various practical exercises such as relaxation techniques, protocols for self-observation and the integration of small exercises into everyday life (&amp;ldquo;tiny task&amp;rdquo;). These help to reduce negative behavior and build up positive behavior. In the course of the project, new trainings are continuously being developed that deal with topics that are relevant for students. The newly developed online health trainings will be examined in randomized clinical studies to evaluate their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;www.studicare.com&#34;&gt;Training Participation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;evidence-based-methods-for-promoting-mental-health-among-students-series-of-meta-analytical-reviews&#34;&gt;Evidence-based methods for promoting mental health among students: Series of meta-analytical reviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to derive appropriate measures, a comprehensive assessment of the current evidence base of psychosocial support services is necessary. In a series of meta-analytical reviews, the current knowledge about effective psychological treatment and prevention services including their effectiveness is collected and critically examined. Psychological interventions and their effectiveness are examined with regard to specific disorder areas (e.g. anxiety symptoms, eating disorders, sleep disorders, suicidal tendencies) or intervention methods (e.g. internet-based procedures, &amp;ldquo;third wave&amp;rdquo; procedures). Along with clinical effectiveness, special attention is devoted to the influence of interventions on the academic impairment of students.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Was Eysenck Right?</title>
      <link>/en/post/eysenck/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/en/post/eysenck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About 65 years ago, German-British psychologist &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Eysenck&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hans-Jürgen Eysenck&lt;/a&gt; (1916-1997) caused a great stir with a paper in which he &lt;a href=&#34;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1953-05921-001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;questioned the effectiveness of psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;. Patients, according to Eysenck, are often better off after some time had passed, even without treatment -psychotherapy is thus ascribed a healing effect that is not caused by it. In short, Eysenck&amp;rsquo;s assessment was that psychotherapy is ineffective, even preventing improvement in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;psychotherapy-is-generally-considered-an-effective-procedure&#34;&gt;Psychotherapy is generally considered an effective procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the randomized controlled trial, which compares treated patients with an untreated control group, and meta-analysis, in which many studies are mathematically summarized, attempted to address Eysencks allegation. Since then, on the basis of such methods, there has been a perceived certainty that psychotherapy, in contrast to Eysenck&amp;rsquo;s allegation, is indeed effective, as a very large decrease in, for example, depressive symptoms has been found in treated versus untreated groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;was-eysenck-right-after-all&#34;&gt;Was Eysenck right after all?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent paper by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/was-eysenck-right-after-all-a-reassessment-of-the-effects-of-psychotherapy-for-adult-depression/AD6D7EDCBA894C295E67503570BF8957&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Reijnders and Ebert&lt;/a&gt; (2018) curbs this enthusiasm about meta-analytic findings on the effectiveness of psychotherapy for depression and addresses the question of whether Eysenck might have been right. In particular, the authors argue that much of the evidence on the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression is distorted by so-called bias, that is systematic errors or artifacts in randomized controlled trials that make the effectiveness of psychotherapy shine in a much brighter light than is actually the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bias can be caused by many factors. When new drugs are developed and evaluated, they are usually compared to a so-called placebo: Patients do not know if they are given a pill with or without an active ingredient. Often, a placebo effect is also found: simply by the fact that patients believe they take an effective drug improves their symptoms, even if it is a sugar pill with no active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This placebo effect is also of particular importance for psychotherapy research: Patients in psychotherapy studies know exactly whether they are receiving the therapeutic treatment  studied or if they are in the control condition. Because patients in the treatment condition expect an effective treatment, this placebo effect alone could improve their symptoms without the treatment itself being significant. On the other hand, patients in the control group know that they are not expected to see any real improvement, which has a negative effect on the alleviation of their symptoms, as these patients often do not change their behavior until they receive treatment after the study has ended. This is just one of many types of bias that might cause psychotherapy to be considered much more effective than it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;findings&#34;&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study by Cuijpers and colleagues therefore attempted to analyze how the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression decreases when controlling for all types of bias. It turned out that for all types of psychotherapy the overall effects decreased heavily. The effectiveness of therapies for depression was overestimated for a long time. It turned out, however, that despite the control of all possible systematic errors, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) still yielded positive results. For psychodynamic procedures, this was not the case, although not even all forms of bias could be controlled for. For other procedures, such as interpersonal therapy, there have been too few studies to make accurate statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis shows that Eysenck&amp;rsquo;s verdict must be taken very seriously, albeit being probably incorrect for very well empirically grounded procedures. More accuracy and more precise research methods are needed to truly ensure the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
