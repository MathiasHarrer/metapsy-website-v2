      <title>From Meta-Analysis to Meta-Analytic Research Domains</title>
      <link>/en/post/metapsy/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recent decades have seen an &lt;strong&gt;unprecedented increase in the amount of research articles&lt;/strong&gt; published each year. Evidence in the form of scientific publications has been increasing almost exponentially, with petabytes of research findings produced on a daily basis. In biomedicine alone, more than one million peer-reviewed articles are published each year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recent &lt;strong&gt;viewpoint&lt;/strong&gt; published in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ebmh.bmj.com/content/early/2022/07/19/ebmental-2022-300509&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;BMJ Evidence-based Mental Health↗&lt;/a&gt;, Cuijpers and colleagues argue that meta-analysis, a common statistical method to synthesize the results of multiple studies, requires an upgrade to keep pace with the breakneck speed of scientific production in the 21st century. They propose the concept of a meta-analytic research domain (MARDs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MARDs are living databases of an entire research domain, which are curated in a way that allows for fast, comprehensive and high-quality evidence synthesis. In contrast to conventional systematic reviews and meta-analyses, MARDs do not focus on one specific population, intervention, comparison, or outcome (PICO), but on an entire research field that is too broad to be covered by one meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While MARDs are resource-intensive and take time to implement, they come with &lt;strong&gt;considerable advantages&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduction of research waste&lt;/strong&gt;. In the biomedical field, a great amount of redundant, misleading, and biased research is produced on a regular basis (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736%2813%2962329-6.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MacLeod et al., 2014&lt;/a&gt;). This is also the case in psychotherapy research (&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0005796719301652&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cristea &amp;amp; Naudet, 2019&lt;/a&gt;). By centralizing all available evidence, unnecessary work can be avoided. Transparent and consistent standards can lead to more trustworthy findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evidence Mapping&lt;/strong&gt;. MARDs provide an overview of limitations and gaps in knowledge and make it possible to see emerging trends in the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meta-Research (“Research on Research”)&lt;/strong&gt;. MARDs allow examining the methods and research practices of an entire field, and how they changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stakeholders outside the scientific community&lt;/strong&gt;. MARDs can enable just-in-time evidence generation for specific research questions. This can be used by e.g. treatment guideline developers or clinicians, to get an overview of the current evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open Science&lt;/strong&gt;. MARDs provide data in a transparent, accessible, and interoperable way. This allows other members of the scientific community to re-use or repurpose the provided information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Core features of a meta-analytic research domain (MARD).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example of a research project developing MARDs is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metapsy.org&#34;&gt;Metapsy↗&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of this project is to provide access to meta-analytic databases of clinical trials investigating the effect of psychological interventions (e.g. psychotherapy, preventive interventions, psychoeducation) on various mental disorders or mental health problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metapsy creates a &lt;strong&gt;unified framework&lt;/strong&gt; for all available meta-analytic data across different indications and settings. All databases are (1) created by university-based research teams using state-of-the-art methodology; (2) updated regularly, at least once each year; (3) formatted using an identical and transparent coding scheme; (4) receive extensive documentation and metadata, including versioning and persistent data identifiers (DOIs), following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;FAIR principles&lt;/a&gt;; and (5) are made publicly available via data repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers can also easily access the databases using the designated R package &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.metapsy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;metapsyData&lt;/a&gt;, and data can be analyzed using state-of-the-art meta-analytic methods; either using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://data.metapsy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;metapsyTools&lt;/a&gt; R package or using an Online Meta-Analysis Tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More information can be found on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.metapsy.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Metapsy website↗&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New Study Shows Limited Effects When Mental Disorders are Only Treated with Smartphone Apps</title>
      <link>/en/post/apps-meta-analysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/en/post/apps-meta-analysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The number of available apps for mental health is steadily increasing in the app stores. In principle, apps could be a low-threshold, anonymous, time- and location-independent and cost-effective supplement to traditional mental health treatment options, but their effectiveness is still largely unclear.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a recently published systematic review, Kiona Weisel et al. examined the effectiveness of smartphone apps as a stand-alone treatment for mental health. The meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials that examined apps for the treatment of adults with increased symptoms of mental disorder compared to a control group. A total of 19 studies with 3681 participants were found with apps to improve depression, anxiety disorders, alcohol consumption, smoking, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorder and self-harming thoughts and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed that smartphone apps had only small effects on depression and smoking behavior, whereas there were no effects on anxiety, self-harming thoughts and behaviors and alcohol consumption. Individual studies with apps for post-traumatic stress disorder were also not effective, while large effects were found in two individual studies on sleep problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apps have enormous potential, but the current study situation is sobering. The approach must be fundamentally distinguished from web-based treatment formats for mental illness, for which numerous studies show that they can have great effects on a wide range of mental illnesses, many of which are even comparable with those of conventional health care services such as pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conclusion: Smartphone apps cannot be recommended as a stand-alone treatment for mental disorders on the basis of the current evidence. If affected persons are interested in digital care services, they should resort to well-studied web-based offers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Was Eysenck Right?</title>
      <link>/en/post/eysenck/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>/en/post/eysenck/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About 65 years ago, German-British psychologist &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Eysenck&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Hans-Jürgen Eysenck&lt;/a&gt; (1916-1997) caused a great stir with a paper in which he &lt;a href=&#34;http://psycnet.apa.org/record/1953-05921-001&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;questioned the effectiveness of psychotherapy&lt;/a&gt;. Patients, according to Eysenck, are often better off after some time had passed, even without treatment -psychotherapy is thus ascribed a healing effect that is not caused by it. In short, Eysenck&amp;rsquo;s assessment was that psychotherapy is ineffective, even preventing improvement in some cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;psychotherapy-is-generally-considered-an-effective-procedure&#34;&gt;Psychotherapy is generally considered an effective procedure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of the randomized controlled trial, which compares treated patients with an untreated control group, and meta-analysis, in which many studies are mathematically summarized, attempted to address Eysencks allegation. Since then, on the basis of such methods, there has been a perceived certainty that psychotherapy, in contrast to Eysenck&amp;rsquo;s allegation, is indeed effective, as a very large decrease in, for example, depressive symptoms has been found in treated versus untreated groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;was-eysenck-right-after-all&#34;&gt;Was Eysenck right after all?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent paper by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/epidemiology-and-psychiatric-sciences/article/was-eysenck-right-after-all-a-reassessment-of-the-effects-of-psychotherapy-for-adult-depression/AD6D7EDCBA894C295E67503570BF8957&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Cuijpers, Karyotaki, Reijnders and Ebert&lt;/a&gt; (2018) curbs this enthusiasm about meta-analytic findings on the effectiveness of psychotherapy for depression and addresses the question of whether Eysenck might have been right. In particular, the authors argue that much of the evidence on the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression is distorted by so-called bias, that is systematic errors or artifacts in randomized controlled trials that make the effectiveness of psychotherapy shine in a much brighter light than is actually the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bias can be caused by many factors. When new drugs are developed and evaluated, they are usually compared to a so-called placebo: Patients do not know if they are given a pill with or without an active ingredient. Often, a placebo effect is also found: simply by the fact that patients believe they take an effective drug improves their symptoms, even if it is a sugar pill with no active ingredient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This placebo effect is also of particular importance for psychotherapy research: Patients in psychotherapy studies know exactly whether they are receiving the therapeutic treatment  studied or if they are in the control condition. Because patients in the treatment condition expect an effective treatment, this placebo effect alone could improve their symptoms without the treatment itself being significant. On the other hand, patients in the control group know that they are not expected to see any real improvement, which has a negative effect on the alleviation of their symptoms, as these patients often do not change their behavior until they receive treatment after the study has ended. This is just one of many types of bias that might cause psychotherapy to be considered much more effective than it actually is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;findings&#34;&gt;Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study by Cuijpers and colleagues therefore attempted to analyze how the effectiveness of psychotherapy in depression decreases when controlling for all types of bias. It turned out that for all types of psychotherapy the overall effects decreased heavily. The effectiveness of therapies for depression was overestimated for a long time. It turned out, however, that despite the control of all possible systematic errors, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) still yielded positive results. For psychodynamic procedures, this was not the case, although not even all forms of bias could be controlled for. For other procedures, such as interpersonal therapy, there have been too few studies to make accurate statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This analysis shows that Eysenck&amp;rsquo;s verdict must be taken very seriously, albeit being probably incorrect for very well empirically grounded procedures. More accuracy and more precise research methods are needed to truly ensure the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
